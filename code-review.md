Overall, nice solutions! Lots of nice one-liners which are elegant and easy to understand. 

My only suggestion for improvement is on variable names - mostly your variable names are good, just some variable names within the callback functions can be better named. (see my inline comments in your code)

- Code hygiene
	- [x] Good indentation
	- [x] No console.logs()
	- [x] No unnecessary comments
	- [x] Followed naming convention for variables
	- [ ] Clear and descriptive variable names 
	- [x] No duplication in code (i.e. code is DRY)

- Functions
	- [x] functions have a single return type
	- [x] functions do what they are supposed to do and nothing more
